a simple in-memory database, trying to copy the best solutions from [[https://github.com/tonsky/datascript][datascript]],
[[https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/][xtdb]], [[https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro][fulcro]], [[https://github.com/lilactown/autonormal][autonormal]] and especially [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-experiments/blob/master/src/main/shadow/experiments/grove/db.cljc][shadow-grove]]. each of them has its own
strengths, and is an excellent solution, but each lacks some of the cool things
that the others have. =doxa= tries to take the best from every solution while
being damn fast and lightweight.
