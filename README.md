a simple in-memory database, trying to copy the best solutions from [datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), [xtdb](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/), [fulcro](https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro), [autonormal](https://github.com/lilactown/autonormal) and especially [shadow-grove](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-experiments/blob/master/src/main/shadow/experiments/grove/db.cljc). each of them has its own strengths, and is an excellent solution, but each lacks some of the cool things that the others have. `doxa` tries to take the best from every solution while being damn fast and lightweight.
